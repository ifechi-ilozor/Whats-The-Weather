# Whats-The-Weather
A weather app where a user enters any city and gets the up to date weather immediately!
Data is retrieved from weather-forecast.com.

Developed in Swift 4 and Xcode 9.


### Specifications:
- The user must enter valid city names (the city exists and is correctly spelled). The
  implementation takes care of incorrect casing, so a user could get results for 
  "new york City" but not "new york Cty".
- The app's results heavily depend on weather-forecast.com. For example, if the site
  changes their HTML layout or their URL structure, the scraping within this project
  needs to be updated to continue outputting valid results.
- This project is a good introduction to iOS development and Swfit, as well as basic
  web scraping and UI design. I made this when independently learning iOS Dev, and I
  hope to make more mobile apps in the future!
